ECS
    - shared components
    - some way to 'bundle' all data for an entity
      - .{id, archetype, []shared_ids, components: Blackboard}
      - blackboard values are *T maybe? A new TypedPointerBlackboard?
      - util fn to apply component values back to archetype columns.
    - handle internal component .init(alloc) and .deinit(alloc) where applicable
    - queries
        from(archetype ids, or null for 'all of them')
        has(component ids)
        has_shared(shared component ids)
        none(component ids)
        none_shared(shared component ids)
        collect()
        iterator()
    - systems
      - interface like AnyColumn
      - execution order

Prefabs
    - a 'whole entity' with predefined values to clone
    - used as resource for redundant and unchanging data,
      a definition of an apple doesn't need to be on every instance.
    - need to be careful when renaming a prefab as it changes it's id,
      may need a tool which looks for the old id and changes it.
