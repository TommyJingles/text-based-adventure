Gameplay
	- text-based, uses console / terminal
    - player enters commands, exe processes it and displays feedback.
    - inspired by: Dungeons & Dragons, Monster Hunter, and Age of Empires
    - There is no 'end game', only to see how long a player can survive and thrive.
		- The game gets harder over time. One or more Major Events can occur simultaneously. 
	- Settings
		- fictional creatures, magic, and 'non-realistic' stuff can be toggled during world creation

world generation
	- The 'world' is defined by a graph (nodes and edges)
        - different node and edge types
        - nodes and edges are entities? seems like a lot of jumping around in memory
        - Actors (Player, NPCs, Mobs) can move bewteen locations (nodes) if they are connected (edges)
        - Locations (nodes) can have a list of Items, Actors, Statonaries (think anvil), etc
        - Connections (edges) can be locked (think door), or not traversable (You can't 'go' to a building, you can go to its entrance room)
    - Major Events	
		- monsters (attacks by beasts)
		- factions (war, treachery, bandits)
		- pestilence (plagues)
		- famine (bugs, drought)
        - natural disasters (earthquakes, wildfires, bad weather)
	- Side Quests
		- fetch quests (X needs N items in Y days)
		- handyman quests (fix X, wrangle Y)
		- hunter quests (slay X, capture Y)
		- diplomatic quests (get X to align|support|trade with Y)
		- commerce quests (increase production by X, secure new trade partner in Y)
    - Exploration
        - ruins, caves, catacombs, wilderness landmarks, a building, etc
		
Baby Steps
	- I'm going to start small: a single village, nearby wilderness regions, and player's farm
		- wilderness regions are like 'biomes' and 'zones' in old-school Monster Hunter games
	- Player can tend to the farm, trade with villagers, take on quests in the wilderness, or go out there and forage.
	- In time I'll add other villages, kingdoms, each territory with unique environments / wilderness
	- Then an economy, diplomacy system, and the like

Player Commands
    - I'm hoping for a natural feel: I sit down next to Mark and say "Did you see what Lucy did?"
    - it maybe more like cmd line style

Crafting
	- I think there's a handful of things an Actor can craft 'by hand', but the rest require stationaries. All require items.
	- example: an anvil (smithing). a barrel (brewing). 
	- stationaries have requirements: need a hammer to use an anvil + need hot metal to use the hammer on.
	- perhaps crafting certain items requires a smithing score (dice roll + skill + advantage from smithing kit?)
	- Items have quality scores which affect their value, abilities, etc.

Food & Drink
	- I want ingredients to give some buffs/nerfs
	- Recipes (combining ingredients, prep methods) produces different buffs/nerfs
	- culunary skill check

Economics / Trade
	- I want to model the entire world, trade, goods, services, you name it.
		- per item / service: scarcity, skill, time, cost of transport, markup + supply and demand
	- This will be a Macro AI, simulating all sorts of things at a high level (Micro AI is per Actor)

Farming
	- a crop plot gets a seed per square unit
	- crop plots can be NxM units in size
	- crop types have various stages, requirements: neutrients, hydration, sunlight, etc
	- various tools can be used, as well as driving livestock into a crop plot.
	- livestock can be penned / corralled
	- need logic for creating farmland from various biomes (if possible)
	
Construction
	- I think it would be cool for Players to build where ever, multiple properties, expandable.
	- stations are like anvils, but I think I'd have another for crop plots?
	- creating roads / paths would be smart. Maybe irrication ditches?
	- requires materials, skill level, extra hands (recruited help), machines (pulley system, etc), time

Dialog
	- I am really hoping this is close to a chatbot, maybe even chat gpt, but we'll see
	- I may have to go for pre-scripted dialog trees with fixed player communication
		- could shake it up with varying the sentences so long as they carry the same meaning.
	- how to make procedural?

Traveling
	- I need a way to simulate the world at varying speeds
	- need fideltiy during Actor interaction, fast summary while 'fast traveling'.
		- fast traveling needs to be be paired with a summary too

Background
	- a lot of background options, each will modify your starting build
	- pros/cons to each option

Time
	- everything takes time and energy. there's a running clock down to the second.
	- some commands are free, such as listing available options for the Actor

Combat
	- initiative-based
	- abilities (such as swing axe, sheild bash, etc)
		- abilities cost energy, require things such as a weapon, so on.
	- A description of an attack is offered, giving the target to pick defense ability (or none).
	- states such as: proned, stunned, dazed, disarmed, ...

Pets and Allies
	- It should be possible to give commands to those you expect to listen, but they may ignore you.

Commanding Forces
	- I need a way for the player to command huge numbers, resolving the battlefield

Dying
	- best find a spouse and have offspring. Those are your 'respawns' when you die.
	- if you're kids aren't old enough, you can respawn as a different relative (a brother, a nephew)
	- if no relative, you are a fresh spawn. You inherit nothing from your past person.
