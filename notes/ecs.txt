Using this code as a starting point: https://devlog.hexops.com/2022/lets-build-ecs-part-2-databases/

Ideas:
  - Types
    - I'll map the component names to a std.hash.XxHash32
    - the runtime type info generates a function for reacting the ErasedComponentStorage
  - Archetype
    - remove isn't working quite as expected (swapback entity index not updating the Pointer)?
  - Some way to 'collect' all components of an entity, json-like printing
    - hashmap(TypeID, AnyPointer) from https://github.com/MasterQ32/any-pointer 
  - Add Shared Data to Archetype
  - Queries
  - World
    - entities, systems, events, shared data
  - Strings
    - Manager? String type? utility functions? regex?
  - Thread Pool / Thread Safety?
