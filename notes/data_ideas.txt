Brainstorming gameplay: components, compostion, systems

Prefabs
    - Prefab struct, PrefabInstance component with prefab_id
    - functions for instancing an entity with the correct components, shared components?
    - ids are hash values of a prefab name?
    - Apple (Component), AppleShared (Shared Component), Type registration includes info for pair these, tagging them as prefab related?


The idea of tagging registered types plus the ability to query for TypeInfo is nice
    Tags: Component, Shared Component, Prefab, Stat, Skill, ...
